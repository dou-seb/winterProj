# Winter-Mini-Project
Welcome to my image classification project to learn ML better

Session Log:

1. 20/12/2024: 
    -Research on convolutional neural networks. Layed out design of CNN and how it can be used to create an image classifyer. Installed libraries and selected a big cat database from Kaggle

**Worked Part-Time job between these dates**

2. 23/12/2024:
    -Ran into library issues and corruption with pytorch (Corrupted version and file path too long to be recognisable by terminal). Debugged the problem by doing as such:
        -Attempted to create a virtual environment (VE) from windows capabilities. VSCode failed to locate interpreter in virtual environment.
        -Installed Anaconda and used a conda VE. Installed python and pytorch onto the VE
    -Committed code to convert image to tensor
    -Created this file
